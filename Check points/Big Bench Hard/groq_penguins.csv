Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5",(A),"To find the answer, let's evaluate each penguin based on the given conditions: being more than 5 years old and weighing more than 12 kg.

1. Louis - 7 years old, 11 kg (does not meet the weight condition)
2. Bernard - 5 years old, 13 kg (does not meet the age condition)
3. Vincent - 9 years old, 11 kg (does not meet the weight condition)
4. Gwen - 8 years old, 15 kg (meets both conditions)

From the given information, only Gwen meets both criteria. However, we should also reconsider Bernard and Vincent since they were initially dismissed for not meeting one of the conditions. Upon reevaluation:

- Bernard is exactly 5 years old, so he is not more than 5 years old.
- Vincent is more than 5 years old but does not weigh more than 12 kg.

Given this, let's re-examine Louis and correct the oversight:
- Louis is more than 5 years old (7 years) but does not weigh more than 12 kg.

Bernard, being exactly 5 years old, doesn't fit the age criterion. However, his weight is more than 12 kg, but since he's not more than 5 years old, he doesn't fit the full criteria.

Upon a detailed review:
- Gwen clearly fits.
- Bernard doesn't fit because he's exactly 5 years old.
- Vincent and Louis don't fit the weight criterion.

But, re-evaluating the initial assessment, it seems there was an oversight in not thoroughly considering all penguins against both criteria simultaneously in the explanation. Given the criteria (more than 5 years old and weighing more than 12 kg), only Gwen clearly meets both. However, let's correct the approach by applying both conditions strictly to each:

1. Gwen - Meets both (more than 5 years old and more than 12 kg)
2. Vincent - More than 5 years old but does not weigh more than 12 kg.
3. Louis - More than 5 years old but does not weigh more than 12 kg.
4. Bernard - Does not meet the age condition as he is exactly 5 years old.

The correct count, based on a strict application of the criteria, should consider penguins that are both older than 5 years and weigh more than 12 kg. This strict application yields Gwen as the only penguin meeting both criteria directly provided in the question. Thus, the answer should reflect the number of penguins that satisfy both given conditions without exception.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

How many penguins are less than 8 years old and weight less than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5",(A),"After deleting Bernard from the table, the remaining penguins are: Louis, Vincent, and Gwen. 

- Louis: 7 years old, 11 kg (less than 8 years old, less than 12 kg)
- Vincent: 9 years old, 11 kg (not less than 8 years old)
- Gwen: 8 years old, 15 kg (not less than 8 years old, not less than 12 kg)

Since only Louis meets both conditions, there is 1 penguin less than 8 years old and weighing less than 12 kg.

The correct answer is:
(A) 1"
